# EmployeeManagement-FullStack

This project is a comprehensive web application that combines the power of React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database. It serves as a fully functional user management system, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for managing user data. The frontend, built with React, offers seamless navigation, allowing users to view, add, edit, and delete user records. The backend, powered by Spring Boot, handles the business logic, API endpoints, and database operations, ensuring efficient data processing and security. The MySQL database stores user information securely, including essential details such as name, username, and email address.

This project showcases the integration of modern web technologies to deliver a robust and scalable solution. It demonstrates best practices in frontend development with React components, state management, and routing. On the backend, it exemplifies the utilization of Spring Boot's dependency injection, RESTful APIs, and database connectivity. The project's emphasis on MySQL ensures data integrity and efficient storage and retrieval of user information.

By combining React, Spring Boot, and MySQL, this project provides a solid foundation for building dynamic and user-centric web applications with seamless frontend-backend communication and reliable data persistence.
